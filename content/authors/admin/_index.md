I'm a master student majoring in Physics with Concentration in Astrophysics/Cosmology at Stony Brook University. During undergraduate, my research was focusing on obeserving transits of exoplanets around white dwarf. I'm current a member of Stony Brook Strong lensing Group, supervised by [Prof.Simon Birrer](https://sibirrer.github.io/). And also a member of the LSST Strong Lensing Science Collaboration. I'm interested in Strong Gravitational lens, Dark Matter and Dark Energy, Cosmology Parameters Modeling, and Simulations.
